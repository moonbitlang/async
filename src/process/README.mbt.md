# Process Management (`@moonbitlang/async/process`)

Asynchronous process spawning and management for MoonBit with support for pipes, environment variables, and I/O redirection.

## Quick Start

### Running Simple Commands

Execute commands and collect their output:

```moonbit check
///|
#cfg(all(target="native", not(platform="windows")))
async test "simple command execution" {
  let (exit_code, output) = @process.collect_stdout("echo", ["Hello, World!"])
  inspect(exit_code, content="0")
  let text = output.text()
  inspect(text.has_prefix("Hello"), content="true")
}

///|
#cfg(all(target="native", not(platform="windows")))
async test "command with exit code" {
  let exit_code = @process.run("sh", ["-c", "exit 42"])
  inspect(exit_code, content="42")
}
```

### Spawn a Process in a Task Group

Use `@process.spawn` to start a process without blocking the current task. It
registers the process with a task group and returns a `Process` handle for
waiting, cancellation, and parent-side pipe access:

```moonbit check
///|
#cfg(all(target="native", not(platform="windows")))
async test "spawn command in background" {
  @async.with_task_group(group => {
    let process = @process.spawn(group, "sh", ["-c", "sleep 0.5; exit 42"])
    // do other stuff while the process is running in the background
    @async.sleep(250)
    // use `.wait()` to wait for the child process, or `.try_wait()` to peek its status
    inspect(process.wait(), content="42")
  })
}
```

Child processes follow the rules of structured concurrency:

- by default, the task group waits for the child process before returning normally,
  unless `no_wait=true` is passed to `@process.spawn`
- in any case, `with_task_group` will wait for the child process before exitting.
  If the task group decides to exit regardless of the child (for example due to fatal error or external cancellation),
  it will cancel the child process automatically, and wait for the child process to finish its cleanup
- `process.cancel()` can be used to manually cancel the child process,
  and `process.wait()` waits for actual termination.

## Collecting Process Output

### Collect Standard Output

Capture stdout from a process:

```moonbit check
///|
#cfg(all(target="native", not(platform="windows")))
async test "collect stdout" {
  let (code, output) = @process.collect_stdout("printf", ["test output"])
  inspect(code, content="0")
  inspect(output.text(), content="test output")
}

///|
#cfg(all(target="native", not(platform="windows")))
async test "collect stdout with args" {
  let (code, output) = @process.collect_stdout("sh", [
    "-c", "echo 'line 1'; echo 'line 2'",
  ])
  inspect(code, content="0")
  let text = output.text()
  inspect(text.contains("line 1"), content="true")
  inspect(text.contains("line 2"), content="true")
}
```

### Collect Standard Error

Capture stderr from a process:

```moonbit check
///|
#cfg(all(target="native", not(platform="windows")))
async test "collect stderr" {
  let (code, output) = @process.collect_stderr("sh", [
    "-c", "printf 'error message' >&2",
  ])
  inspect(code, content="0")
  inspect(output.text(), content="error message")
}
```

### Collect Both Stdout and Stderr

Capture both output streams separately:

```moonbit check
///|
#cfg(all(target="native", not(platform="windows")))
async test "collect both streams" {
  let (code, stdout, stderr) = @process.collect_output("sh", [
    "-c", "printf 'out msg'; printf 'err msg' >&2",
  ])
  inspect(code, content="0")
  inspect(stdout.text(), content="out msg")
  inspect(stderr.text(), content="err msg")
}
```

### Collect Merged Output

Merge stdout and stderr into a single stream:

```moonbit check
///|
#cfg(all(target="native", not(platform="windows")))
async test "collect merged output" {
  let (code, output) = @process.collect_output_merged("sh", [
    "-c", "printf 'ab'; printf 'cd' >&2; printf 'ef'",
  ])
  inspect(code, content="0")
  inspect(output.text(), content="abcdef")
}
```

## Process I/O with Pipes

### Reading from Process

Use `@process.read_from_process()` with `@process.spawn` to create a pipe lazily.
Output is available through `.stdout` or `.stderr` on the returned child handle:

```moonbit check
///|
#cfg(all(target="native", not(platform="windows")))
async test "read from process with pipe" {
  @async.with_task_group(group => {
    let child = @process.spawn(
      group,
      "echo",
      ["Hello from process"],
      stdout=@process.read_from_process(),
    )
    defer child.stdout.close()
    let output = child.stdout.read_all().text()
    inspect(output.has_prefix("Hello"), content="true")
  })
}
```

### Writing to Process

Use `@process.write_to_process()` with `@process.spawn` to create a pipe lazily.
Input can be written through `.stdin` on the returned child handle. Close
`.stdin` when writing is complete so the child observes end-of-file:

```moonbit check
///|
#cfg(all(target="native", not(platform="windows")))
async test "write to process with pipe" {
  @async.with_task_group(group => {
    let child = @process.spawn(
      group,
      "cat",
      ["-"],
      stdin=@process.write_to_process(),
      stdout=@process.read_from_process(),
    )
    group.spawn_bg(() => {
      defer child.stdin.close()
      child.stdin.write(b"test input\n")
    })
    group.spawn_bg(() => {
      defer child.stdout.close()
      let output = child.stdout.read_all().text()
      inspect(output.contains("test input"), content="true")
    })
  })
}
```

`read_from_process()` and `write_to_process()` are for one child created with
`spawn()`. Their child-side handles are closed automatically after process
creation. The returned `Process.stdin`, `Process.stdout`, and `Process.stderr`
channels must be closed by the caller when those channels were requested.

## File Redirection

### Redirect from File

Use a file as process input:

```moonbit check
///|
#cfg(all(target="native", not(platform="windows")))
async test "redirect input from file" {
  @async.with_task_group(root => {
    let input_file = "_build/process_test_input.txt"
    @fs.write_file(input_file, "file content")
    root.add_defer(() => @fs.remove(input_file))
    let (code, output) = @process.collect_stdout(
      "cat",
      [],
      stdin=@process.redirect_from_file(input_file),
    )
    inspect(code, content="0")
    inspect(output.text(), content="file content")
  })
}
```

### Redirect to File

Write process output to a file:

```moonbit check
///|
#cfg(all(target="native", not(platform="windows")))
async test "redirect output to file" {
  @async.with_task_group(root => {
    let output_file = "_build/process_test_output.txt"
    root.add_defer(() => @fs.remove(output_file))
    let code = @process.run(
      "echo",
      ["test output"],
      stdout=@process.redirect_to_file(output_file),
    )
    inspect(code, content="0")
    let content = @fs.read_file(output_file).text()
    inspect(content.has_prefix("test output"), content="true")
  })
}
```

### File to File Redirection

Copy file content using process redirection:

```moonbit check
///|
#cfg(all(target="native", not(platform="windows")))
async test "file to file redirection" {
  @async.with_task_group(root => {
    let input_file = "_build/process_redirect_in.txt"
    let output_file = "_build/process_redirect_out.txt"
    @fs.write_file(input_file, "redirect test")
    root.add_defer(() => @fs.remove(input_file))
    root.add_defer(() => @fs.remove(output_file))
    let _ = @process.run(
      "cat",
      [],
      stdin=@process.redirect_from_file(input_file),
      stdout=@process.redirect_to_file(output_file),
    )
    inspect(@fs.read_file(output_file).text(), content="redirect test")
  })
}
```

`redirect_from_file()` and `redirect_to_file()` are lazy, single-process
redirections. The file is opened while the process is created and the parent
copy of the file handle is closed automatically afterward.

### Share a File Redirection

Use `redirect_to_file_shared()` when multiple children must inherit the same
open output file. Unlike the single-process helper, it opens the file
immediately and returns a `SharedProcessOutput` owned by the caller. Close it
after it has been passed to the last child, or if spawning is abandoned:

```moonbit check
///|
#cfg(all(target="native", not(platform="windows")))
async test "redirect multiple processes to one file" {
  let output_file = "_build/process_shared_output.txt"
  defer @fs.remove(output_file)
  let output = @process.redirect_to_file_shared(output_file)
  {
    defer output.close()
    @async.with_task_group(group => {
      @process.spawn(group, "printf", ["first"], stdout=output) |> ignore
      @process.spawn(group, "printf", ["second"], stdout=output) |> ignore
    })
  }
  let content = @fs.read_file(output_file).text()
  inspect(content.contains("first"), content="true")
  inspect(content.contains("second"), content="true")
}
```

`redirect_from_file_shared()` similarly returns a caller-owned
`SharedProcessInput`. Children using it share one open file description and
therefore one file offset: data consumed by one child is no longer available to
the others. Always close the value after its last use.

## Environment Variables

### Setting Environment Variables

Pass custom environment variables to processes:

```moonbit check
///|
#cfg(all(target="native", not(platform="windows")))
async test "set environment variable" {
  let (code, output) = @process.collect_stdout("sh", ["-c", "echo $MY_VAR"], extra_env={
    "MY_VAR": "my_value",
  })
  inspect(code, content="0")
  inspect(output.text().trim(), content="my_value")
}

///|
#cfg(all(target="native", not(platform="windows")))
async test "multiple environment variables" {
  let (code, output) = @process.collect_stdout(
    "sh",
    ["-c", "echo $VAR1-$VAR2"],
    extra_env={ "VAR1": "first", "VAR2": "second" },
  )
  inspect(code, content="0")
  inspect(output.text().trim(), content="first-second")
}
```

### Isolated Environment

Run process without inheriting parent environment:

```moonbit check
///|
#cfg(all(target="native", not(platform="windows")))
async test "isolated environment" {
  let (code, output) = @process.collect_stdout(
    "env",
    [],
    extra_env={ "ONLY_VAR": "only_value" },
    inherit_env=false,
  )
  inspect(code, content="0")
  let text = output.text()
  inspect(text.contains("ONLY_VAR=only_value"), content="true")
  // Parent environment variables won't be present
  inspect(text.contains("PATH="), content="false")
}
```

## Working Directory

### Change Working Directory

Execute processes in a specific directory:

```moonbit check
///|
#cfg(all(target="native", not(platform="windows")))
async test "set working directory" {
  let (code, output) = @process.collect_stdout("pwd", [], cwd="src")
  inspect(code, content="0")
  let text = output.text().trim()
  // Check that the path ends with "src" (works across OSes)
  inspect(text.has_suffix("src"), content="true")
}

///|
#cfg(all(target="native", not(platform="windows")))
async test "relative path in cwd" {
  let (code, output) = @process.collect_stdout("ls", [], cwd="src")
  inspect(code, content="0")
  let text = output.text()
  // Should list contents of src directory
  let has_content = text.length() > 0
  inspect(has_content, content="true")
}
```

## Asynchronous Process Management

### Spawn and Wait

`run()` waits in the current task. `spawn()` starts the process in a task group
and returns a handle immediately:

```moonbit check
///|
#cfg(all(target="native", not(platform="windows")))
async test "spawn and wait" {
  @async.with_task_group(group => {
    let child = @process.spawn(group, "sleep", ["0.1"])
    inspect(child.pid > 0, content="true")
    inspect(child.try_wait() is None, content="true")
    inspect(child.wait(), content="0")
  })
}

///|
#cfg(all(target="native", not(platform="windows")))
async test "wait for specific exit code" {
  let exit_code = @process.run("sh", ["-c", "exit 5"])
  inspect(exit_code, content="5")
}
```

The `Process` handle exposes:

- `pid`, the operating-system process identifier;
- `stdin`, when `stdin=write_to_process()` was requested;
- `stdout` and `stderr`, when the corresponding stream uses
  `read_from_process()`;
- `wait()`, `try_wait()`, and `cancel()` for lifecycle management.

Only use the pipe fields configured during `spawn()`, and close each configured
field when it is no longer needed.

### Cancellation

Cancelling the task running `run()`, cancelling the task group containing a
spawned process, or calling `Process.cancel()` invokes the process cancellation
handler. The default is `graceful_cancel(timeout=5000)`: it sends `SIGTERM` on
POSIX systems or `SIGBREAK` on Windows, waits up to five seconds, and then kills
the process if necessary.

Use `hard_cancel()` to kill immediately, or construct
`graceful_cancel(timeout~, signal?)` to select a timeout and, on POSIX systems,
a signal. `Process.cancel()` initiates cancellation; call `Process.wait()` when
the code must wait until the process has actually terminated.

### Spawn Orphan Process

Start an orphan process with an unbounded lifetime.
The orphan process will not be automatically cancelled,
and may live longer than the main process.
It is recommended to use `@process.spawn` or `@process.run` whenever possible,
use `@process.spawn_orphan` only when it is absolutely necessary:

```moonbit check
///|
#cfg(all(target="native", not(platform="windows")))
async test "spawn orphan and wait later" {
  let pid = @process.spawn_orphan("sh", ["-c", "sleep 0.1; exit 7"])

  // Do other work...
  @async.sleep(50)

  // Wait for the process to complete
  let exit_code = @process.wait_pid(pid)
  inspect(exit_code, content="7")
}
```

## Advanced Usage

### Merge Output Streams

Use `@process.duplicate_stdout()` to redirect `stderr` to the same channel as `stdout` for a child process:

```moonbit check
///|
#cfg(all(target="native", not(platform="windows")))
async test "merge stdout and stderr" {
  @async.with_task_group(group => {
    let child = @process.spawn(
      group,
      "sh",
      ["-c", "echo 'to stdout'; echo 'to stderr' >&2"],
      stdout=@process.read_from_process(),
      stderr=@process.duplicate_stdout(),
    )
    defer child.stdout.close()
    let output = child.stdout.read_all().text()
    inspect(output.contains("to stdout"), content="true")
    inspect(output.contains("to stderr"), content="true")
  })
}
```

### Multiple Processes Sharing Output

`read_from_process_shared()` creates a parent reader and a `SharedProcessOutput` that can
be passed to multiple children, allowing the parent to collect their merged
output. Unlike `read_from_process()`, both ends are explicit and caller-owned.

```moonbit check
///|
#cfg(all(target="native", not(platform="windows")))
async test "multiple processes to one pipe" {
  @async.with_task_group(root => {
    let (reader, writer) = @process.read_from_process_shared()
    root.spawn_bg(no_wait=true, () => {
      defer reader.close()
      let output = reader.read_all().text()
      inspect(output.contains("first"), content="true")
      inspect(output.contains("second"), content="true")
    })
    @async.with_task_group(group => {
      // Close the shared child-side handle after spawning the last child.
      defer writer.close()
      @process.spawn(group, "echo", ["first"], stdout=writer) |> ignore
      @process.spawn(group, "echo", ["second"], stdout=writer) |> ignore
    })
  })
}
```

### Other Shared Pipes

`write_to_process_shared()` returns a `SharedProcessInput` for children and a
`WriteToProcess` for the parent. It is useful when the same input stream must be
passed to multiple children, or when using `run()`, `spawn_orphan()`, or a
collection helper instead of `spawn()`. Children share the stream: each byte is
consumed by only one reader.

`pipe()` returns a `(SharedProcessInput, SharedProcessOutput)` pair for direct
child-to-child communication. Pass the output to the producer and the input to
the consumer. Both handles remain caller-owned and must be closed after the
last corresponding child has been spawned, or if spawning fails.

For every shared pipe, also close the parent-facing `ReadFromProcess` or
`WriteToProcess` when reading or writing is complete. Failing to close the last
writer can prevent readers from observing end-of-file.

## Types Reference

`ProcessInput` and `ProcessOutput` are the redirection types accepted by
`run()`, `spawn()`, `spawn_orphan()`, and the collection helpers.

| API or value | Redirection role | Ownership and closing |
|---|---|---|
| `@stdio.stdin` | `ProcessInput` | Borrowed; not closed by the process API |
| `@stdio.stdout`, `@stdio.stderr` | `ProcessOutput` | Borrowed; not closed by the process API |
| `write_to_process()` | Single-child `ProcessInput` | Child side is automatic; close returned `Process.stdin` |
| `read_from_process()` | Single-child `ProcessOutput` | Child side is automatic; close returned `Process.stdout` or `.stderr` |
| `redirect_from_file(path)` | Single-child `ProcessInput` | Opened lazily and closed automatically after process creation |
| `redirect_to_file(path, ...)` | Single-child `ProcessOutput` | Opened lazily and closed automatically after process creation |
| `pipe_from_parent()` | `SharedProcessInput` plus parent writer | Caller closes both ends |
| `pipe_to_parent()` | Parent reader plus `SharedProcessOutput` | Caller closes both ends |
| `pipe()` | `SharedProcessInput` plus `SharedProcessOutput` | Caller closes both ends |
| `redirect_from_file_shared(path)` | `SharedProcessInput` | Caller closes it after its last use |
| `redirect_to_file_shared(path, ...)` | `SharedProcessOutput` | Caller closes it after its last use |

`duplicate_stdout()` is a special `ProcessOutput` accepted only as `stderr`; it
makes the child inherit the same destination as its `stdout` and does not own a
separate handle.

## Best Practices

1. **Close every caller-owned channel**, preferably immediately after acquiring
   it with `defer channel.close()`.
2. **Use collection helpers** for simple output capture.
3. **Use `spawn()` for interactive pipes**, because the parent endpoints are
   returned on the `Process` handle.
4. **Use shared redirections only when sharing is required**, and close them
   after the last child has been spawned.
5. **Handle exit codes** explicitly; a nonzero exit is not a spawning error.
6. **Prefer `spawn()` or `run()`** and use `spawn_orphan()` only when the process
   must outlive structured concurrency.

## Error Handling

Failure to create a process or initialize a redirection raises an error. Once a
process starts successfully, its exit status is returned as an integer; a
nonzero status is not raised as an error. If a process is killed by a signal on
POSIX systems, its status is the negative signal number.

```moonbit check
///|
#cfg(all(target="native", not(platform="windows")))
async test "handle process errors" {
  // Non-existent command fails
  @test_util.assert_raise_async(() => @process.run("nonexistent_command", []))
}

///|
#cfg(all(target="native", not(platform="windows")))
async test "exit code indicates failure" {
  let exit_code = @process.run("sh", ["-c", "exit 1"])
  let is_failure = exit_code != 0
  inspect(is_failure, content="true")
}
```

For complete examples, see the test files in `src/process/`.
